3. Mark goals as completed and receive progress notifications.
4. Change the theme using the theme toggle button.

### New Feature: Single Persistent Notification

- When goals are updated, the previous notification is replaced with a new one.
- The notification includes:
  - ‚úÖ Completed Goals
  - ‚è≥ Remaining Goals
- **Implementation Details:**
  - Uses a `tag: "ramadan-goals"` to replace existing notifications.
